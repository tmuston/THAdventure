~~1~The Town Hall entrance~You are stood inside the imposingly grand entrance to a mid-victorian Town Hall.  It looks like the party here last night was a bit boistrous, as there is quite a bit of mess.~0~2~0~0~0~0
~~2~Tourist Information Centre~This is the Tourist Information Centre.  It's the place to go for show tickets, travel information or to buy souvenirs of the town.~3~0~0~1~0~0
~~3~Outer foyer~This is the outer foyer.  It's a little dark in here, but you can still see that there is a fibreglass bear standing about four feet tall, and a door which appears to lead inside.  The door is open~4~0~0~0~0~0
~~4~Inner foyer~This is the inner foyer.  By the looks of the debris on the floor, last night's partygoers were having a really messy time.  The door shuts and locks behind you.  There is a button to open the door.~11~5~0~8~6~0

~~10~Disabled toilets~Now you know where the smell was coming from.  This is going to need more than a bit of tidying.  ~8~0~0~0~0~0
~~11~Bar area~This isn't quite as bad as expected.  Someone's obviously been annoyed, as there is a large boot print on the door, but apart from that it's business as usual.~12~0~4~0~0~0
~~12~Main Hall~The main hall is almost completely filled with chairs and round tables.  The floor is in a state that can only be described as carnage.  You're going to need the services of Henry the vacuum cleaner here.~0~0~11~0~0~0
~~13~Top Corridor~The top corridor is eerily quiet and dark.  Not even the traffic outside penetrates here.~0~0~0~0~0~7
