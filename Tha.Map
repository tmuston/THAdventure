~~1~The Town Hall entrance~You are stood inside the imposingly grand entrance to a mid-victorian Town Hall.  It looks like the party here last night was a bit boistrous, as there is quite a bit of mess.~0~2~0~0~0~0
~~2~Tourist Information Centre~This is the Tourist Information Centre.  It's the place to go for show tickets, travel information or to buy souvenirs of the town.~0~0~0~1~0~0

~~4~Inner foyer~This is the inner foyer.  By the looks of the debris on the floor, last night's partygoers were having a really messy time.  The door shuts and locks behind you.  There is a button to open the door.~11~5~0~8~6~0

~~12~Main Hall~The main hall is almost completely filled with chairs and round tables.  The floor is in a state that can only be described as carnage.  <newline><newline>You're going to need the services of Henry the vacuum cleaner here.~23~0~11~25~0~0
~~13~Top Corridor~The top corridor is eerily quiet and dark.  Not even the traffic outside penetrates here.~14~0~0~0~0~7

~~26~Main gents toilets~I bet you wish you'd not looked in here.  It looks like a bomb has hit the place.  Toilet paper and a broken seat litter the floor.  The water is soaked because somebody blocked a sink and flooded the floor, and somebody has been ill in one of the urinals~25~0~0~0~0~0

~~33~Clock Tower~You feel faint.<newline>You are stood inside the clock tower.  Looking down through the slats in the tower you see an odd sight.  Instead of cars and lorries, you see horses and carts.  The streetlights are all gas-powered.~33~0~0~0~0~0
~~34~Magistrates court~This is definitely strange.  You are in what appears to be a court room.  There is a dock, and a 'bench' where the three magistrates would sit.<newline>It looks like the room is lit by gaslights.~35~36~33~0~0~0
